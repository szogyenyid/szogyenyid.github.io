"Going what?" - asked my colleagues on Friday's small talk session.
TODO

## Serverless

TODO: serverless is about having servers, but not having to care about them
TODO: some thoughts about AWS Serverless stuff: Lambda, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway, Cognito, and how easy it is to create a single crud app with them

## Emitting backend code

TODO: API Gateway can integrate with a huge lot of AWS services
TODO: using Mapping Templates, we can customize integration requests based on method requests to such extent, that backend code is no longer needed

## Using integration requests mapping

TODO: some paragraphs on how to use integration requests' mapping templates to control what happens on the integrated AWS service.

## A demo app using S3, Cognito, API Gateway, DynamoDB

TODO: a diagram about the architecture
TODO: description of the parts of the app, and how / why do they work
