I am a Senior Software Engineer at [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/), working on the backend of the end user product.

Formerly, I was a Software Architect at [Case Solvers](https://case-solvers.com/), where I was responsible for company-wide programming and system design related decisions.

I spent 2 years on Electrical Engineering BSc at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, specialized in digital signal processing, then I switched to the Computer Science bachelor's programme, where I've chosen the "Data Engineer" specialization.

I have a passion for modern web technologies (mostly backend), education and environmental sustainability.
