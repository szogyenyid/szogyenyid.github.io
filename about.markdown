I am a Software Architect at [Case Solvers](https://case-solvers.com/), where I am responsible for company-wide programming-related decisions and the design of most of our databases and data warehouses.

I spent 2 years on Electrical Engineering BSc at Budapest University of Technology and Economics, specialized in digital signal processing, then I switched to the Computer Science bachelor's programme, where I've chosen the "Data Engineer" specialization.

I have a passion for exploratory data analysis, data mining, education and environmental sustainability.
