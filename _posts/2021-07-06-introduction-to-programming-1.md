## What is programming?

In my opinion programming is a **mindset**. The main part is not about writing code, but understanding the essential problem, and solving it. Okay, solving involves coding, rules, conventions, but it can be done many ways. The aim is to plan the **logical steps of getting to your solution**.  

Let's see a dumb example: `I want to eat a PB&J sandwich`.  
The problem is, `I don't have one`.  
I would solve it by going to the store, buying PB, jelly, and bread (I already know I have knives at home). Before I get out the house, I take my wallet, because I will have to pay. After getting home, I take out a slice of bread from the bag, open the jar of PB and jelly, get a knife, spread them on the bread, and basically I'm done.

One could say: _what does "spreading" mean? How thick layers do I want?_  
In my understanding, those are part of the "coding" (or the language), these are parameters which can be changed in a second. Just think about it: if I go to the store without planning, and forgot my wallet at home, I will have to go back home, get the wallet, go to the store again, get the stuff again, wasting a lot of time and effort. The question of the PB layer thickness is not the part of my plan, because

1. it depends on my mood/taste
2. it can be changed with one move

So, programming is about planning something, and coding is about implementing it.

## Programming vs Coding

> Programming is about planning something, and coding is about implementing it.

In other words, "programming" has a somehow abstract output - the logic of the program to be done - which is mostly done by your brain, and not your fingers. At larger companies there are positions where someone's work is mostly about programming, not _coding_. Of course, every _programmer_ must write code during their job, it's about the ratio.

Coding is a different kind of activity, it needs a totally different approach, and a whole other mindset. It's not about planning the logical steps, you already have them. This step is for the manifestation, where something theoretical becomes practical. Someone who codes have to know a lot of things, like rules of the chosen language, general and company-exclusive coding conventions, version management, and hundreds of other complicated or not-so-complicated stuff.

## How to learn what?

You may already guessed: learning to program and learning to code are two totally different things.  
If you are a programmer, you must know how to code & try your solution. As a coder, your programming skills don't have to be as high, but you have to know a (few) language(s) and some extralingual rules and methods well.

In my opinion learning to code is easier, and not only because it's less abstract. There are ~infinite sources and free courses available online if you want to learn &lt;insert any language here&gt;, but it's extremely hard to find materials about **programming**, and if you find something, it's harder to learn without a mentor. A code is something that you can easily try, and see if it works, while a logical mistake is so much harder to identify and fix.
