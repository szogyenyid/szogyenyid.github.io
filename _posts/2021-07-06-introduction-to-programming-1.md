description: What is programming? Is it different from coding, or are they the same thing? How do you learn one or the other? I do not have the clearest and and most satisfying answers ever, but I am trying to clarify things in this article.

## What is programming?

In my opinion programming is a **mindset**. The main part is not about writing code, but understanding the essential problem, and solving it. Okay, solving involves coding, rules, conventions, but it can be done many ways. The aim is to plan the **logical steps of getting to your solution**.  

Let's see a dumb example: **I want to eat a PB&J sandwich**.  
The problem is, **I don't have one**.  
I would solve it by going to the store, buying PB, jelly, and bread (I already know I have knives at home). Before I get out the house, I take my wallet, because I will have to pay. After getting home, I take out a slice of bread from the bag, open the jar of PB and jelly, get a knife, spread them on the bread, and basically I'm done.

One could say: _what does "spreading" mean? How thick layers do I want?_  
In my understanding, those are part of the "coding" (or the language), these are parameters which can be changed in a second. Just think about it: if I go to the store without planning, and forgot my wallet at home, I will have to go back home, get the wallet, go to the store again, get the stuff again, wasting a lot of time and effort. The question of the PB layer thickness is not the part of my plan, because

1. it depends on my mood/taste
2. it can be changed with one move

So, **programming is about planning something**, and coding is about implementing it.

## Programming vs Coding

> Programming is about planning something, and coding is about implementing it.

In other words, "programming" has a somehow abstract output - **the logic of the program to be done** - which is mostly done by your brain, and not your fingers. At larger companies there are positions where someone's work is mostly about programming, not _coding_. Of course, every _programmer_ must write code during their job, it's about the ratio.

Coding is a different kind of activity, it needs a totally different approach, and a whole other mindset. It's not about planning the logical steps, you already have them. This step is for the manifestation, where something **theoretical becomes practical**. Someone who codes have to know a lot of things, like rules of the chosen language, general and company-exclusive coding conventions, version management, and hundreds of other complicated or not-so-complicated stuff.

## How to learn what?

You may have already guessed: learning to program and learning to code are two completely different things.  
If you are a programmer, you must know how to code & try your solution. As a coder, your programming skills don't have to be as high, but you have to know a (few) language(s) and extralingual rules and methods as well.

In my opinion learning to code is easier, and not only because it's less abstract. There are ~infinite sources and free courses available online if you want to learn &lt;insert any language here&gt;, but it's extremely hard to find materials about **programming**, and if you find something, it's harder to learn on your own. A code is something that you can easily try, and see if it works, while a logical mistake is so much harder to identify and fix.

In this blog I will try the almost impossible: teach the basics of programming.  
But if I want to teach programming, I have to teach some coding too, so I have to choose a language.

One of the easiest things online is to find a comment war (on any platform) under a question like _"I want to start programming, which language should I choose?"_. Choosing a language can be hard, but to be honest, if you want to program - and not just code - it doesn't really matter. Every general-purpose programming language will do (please don't choose markup, modeling, or domain-specific languages), eg. Python, Java, PHP or C. Of course, all of them has advantages and disadvantages, there isn't a perfect choice.

And here's the point where I will be one of the most unpopular tutors according to some coders: I will teach you to program using **C language as the main tool**.  
It is low level, close to the hardware, and probably the most abstract, furthest away language (among the most popular ones) from English. In my theory, if you understand the fundamentals of C, it will be a piece of cake to learn any other programming language, as you will **not just know, but understand** what's going on, and what does the computer do. It will not be easy, but I will try my best to make this journey entertaining and useful!
