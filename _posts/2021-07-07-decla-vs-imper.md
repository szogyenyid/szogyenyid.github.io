## Methods of giving a solution

There are several ways of giving a solution for a given problem. Now I would like to introduce two groups of solutions (or even knowledge): **Declarative** and **Imperative**.

### Declarative approach

Declarative knowledge answers the question "What is true?" and makes statements. Using our declarative knowledge, we can always check if a statement we have is true or false (or we don't know).

Example: the square root of a number.
Our declarative knowledge would say "the square root of a number $$ x $$ is a number $$ y $$ such that $$ y^2 = x $$ and $$ y\geqslant0 $$".

### Imperative approach

<div>
    <span style="width:50%; text-align: left;">Previous part: To be filled</span>
    <span style="width:50%; text-align: right;">Next part: Coming soon</span>
</div>
