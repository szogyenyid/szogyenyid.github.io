## What is programming?

In my opinion programming is a __mindset__. The main part is not about writing code, but understanding the essential problem, and solving it. Okay, solving involves coding, rules, conventions, but it can be done many ways. The aim is to plan the __logical steps of getting to your solution__.  

Let's see a dumb example: `I want to eat a PB&J sandwich`.  
The problem is, `I don't have one`.  
I would solve it by going to the store, buying PB, jelly, and bread (I already know I have knives at home). Before I get out the house, I take my wallet, because I will have to pay. After getting home, I take out a slice of bread from the bag, open the jar of PB and jelly, get a knife, spread them on the bread, and basically I'm done.  
One could say: okay, but what does "spreading" mean? How thick layers do I want?

In my understanding, those are part of the "coding", these are parameters which can be changed in a second. Just think about it: if I go to the store without planning, and forgot my wallet at home, I will have to go back home, get the wallet, go to the store again, get the stuff again, wasting a lot of time and effort. The question of the PB layer thickness is not the part of my plan, because

1. It depends on my mood/taste
2. It can be changed with one move
