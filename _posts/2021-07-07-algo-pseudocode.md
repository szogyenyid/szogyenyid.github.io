## Specification to algorithm

In programming, we usually get a specification, which is the description of a problem. In the majority of the times it is something **[declarative][decimp-decla]**, and programmers have the task to create an **imperative** solution, such a method that generates the wanted output using the given input.  
So, specification is all about "what to solve" and an algorithm is about "how to solve". The programmer's responsibility is converting the "what" to "how", and the rest of this "Introduction to Programming" course will talk about essentials you must know to be able to do this conversion.
